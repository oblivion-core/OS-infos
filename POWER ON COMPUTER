what happened when u wake your computer by clicking  the power on button : 
-the ATX power supply detect that the computer is on by PS_ON signal  
-the power supply unit activates and begins delivering full power(12V,6V..) to thhe motherboard before then the psu make sure that the voltage is stable 
to send the power good signal to motherboard 
-the motherboard chipset(set of electronics that control data flows between CPU and other components) receives power and then make sure 
that every component of the pc is on known state and ready to function by a RESET signal (it's like 3.2.1 ready go)
- in X86 the cpu after release of the RESET signal begins excuting at a memory address 0xFFFFFFF0 in real mode("real mode is like "the starter mode"
for x86 cpu it can only access 1MB of memory bcz it's only use 16 bit register") we call that specific block of memory address "reset vector"
